PLEASE NOTE: '%' INDICATES THE EXPLAINATION FOR THE CODE

UNIT IMPULSE SIGNAL:
clc;clear all;close all;
n=-2:1:2;
g= [zeros(1,2),ones(1,1),zeros(1,2)]
figure= (1)
stem (n,y);
xlabel("Time")
ylabel("amplitude")
title('unit impluse');

code explanation:

clc;         % Clear the Command Window
clear all;   % Clear all variables from the workspace
close all;   % Close all open figure windows
n = -2:1:2;  % Create a vector 'n' ranging from -2 to 2 with a step size of 1
g = [zeros(1,2), ones(1,1), zeros(1,2)]; 
% In this line, a vector g is created with the values [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This vector represents an impulse signal, where the middle element is 1 (indicating the impulse) and the rest are 0.
figure = (1);  
%This line creates a variable named figure and assigns the value 1 to it. It seems like there is a misunderstanding here â€“ it's not necessary to assign a value to figure like this.
stem(n, g);  
%This line uses the stem function to create a stem plot. The values in vector g are plotted against the corresponding values in vector n. This will display the impulse signal as a stem plot.
xlabel("Time")  
ylabel("Amplitude")
title('Unit Impulse');
% These lines add labels and a title to the plot. xlabel sets the label for the x-axis, ylabel sets the label for the y-axis, and title sets the title of the plot.
So, the code essentially generates an impulse signal using the vector g and plots it using the stem function, labeling the axes and providing a title to the plot. However, there seems to be a minor issue with the line assigning a value to figure, as mentioned above.
